## What is PyWebTransport?

This library enables low-latency, bidirectional communication over QUIC and HTTP/3.
It provides a complete, robust implementation of streams and datagrams
alongside a high-level application framework, with a focus on standards compliance,
performance, and reliability.

**Key Features:**

- **Pure Async**: Built entirely on `asyncio` for high-concurrency, non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Event Architecture**: Powered by a Sans-I/O unified state machine and a strictly typed `EventEmitter`.
- **Zero-Copy I/O**: End-to-end support for `memoryview` and buffer protocols to minimize data copying overhead.
- **Structured Messaging**: Transmission of typed Python objects via pluggable serializers (`JSON`, `MsgPack`, `Protobuf`).
- **High-Level Abstractions**: `ServerApp` with routing and middleware, plus `WebTransportClient` utilities for fleet management.
- **Protocol Completeness**: Implementation of bidirectional streams, unidirectional streams, and unreliable datagrams.
- **Resource Safety**: Async context managers for automatic connection, session, and stream lifecycle management.
- **Type-Safe & Tested**: Fully type-annotated API with comprehensive unit, integration, end-to-end, and benchmark coverage.

## Core Concepts

### Client and Server

The library provides two main entry points: `WebTransportClient` for creating client connections and `ServerApp` for building server applications with routing and middleware.

### Sessions

A `WebTransportSession` represents an active connection and is the primary interface for communication. Each session can manage multiple streams and datagrams.

### Streams

Streams provide reliable, ordered communication with automatic flow control. Use bidirectional streams for request-response patterns and unidirectional streams for one-way data transfer.

### Datagrams

Datagrams offer low-latency, unreliable, and out-of-order messaging, ideal for real-time applications where speed is more important than guaranteed delivery.

## Use Cases

### Real-time Interactivity

- **Live Collaboration:** Real-time document editing, whiteboarding, and design tools.
- **Instant Messaging:** Live chat, notifications, and signaling services.
- **Interactive Entertainment:** Multiplayer online gaming, virtual reality (VR), and live stream interactions.
- **Real-time Dashboards:** Financial trading platforms, monitoring panels, and live sports updates.

### High-Performance Data Streaming

- **Media Streaming:** Live video, audio feeds, and webcam broadcasting.
- **Large-Scale Data Transfer:** Bulk file uploads/downloads and data synchronization.
- **IoT & Telemetry:** Efficiently aggregating sensor data from a multitude of devices.

### AI & Machine Learning

- **Real-time Inference:** Stream live audio, video, or sensor data to models for analysis.
- **Distributed Training:** Efficiently exchange model gradients and parameters between nodes.
- **Data Augmentation:** Feed large datasets to augmentation pipelines with low latency.

### Modern Backend Architecture

- **Microservice Communication:** A low-latency, high-throughput message bus between services.
- **API Acceleration:** Reduce repetitive HTTP overhead with persistent connections.
- **Edge Computing:** Establish efficient data channels between edge nodes and the cloud.
